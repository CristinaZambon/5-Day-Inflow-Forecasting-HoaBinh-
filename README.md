# 5-Day-Inflow-Forecasting-HoaBinh
MATLAB project for the Natural Resources Management course (AY 2024/2025) focused on forecasting the cumulative 5-day inflow to the Hoa Binh reservoir using hydrological and precipitation data.  Different linear and nonlinear models are tested with input selection and overfitting control, and a single final model is selected for contest evaluation.
